## Welcome

Thanks for joining us! In this workshop, we'll take a quick refresher on GitHub _Apps_ and understand how they compare to GitHub _Actions_. We'll guide you through the decision processes needed when understanding how best to integrate with GitHub. And then, weâ€™ll spend some time walking through the conversion of a GitHub App to an Action.
