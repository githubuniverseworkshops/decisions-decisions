# Decisions, Decisions: GitHub Apps or GitHub Actions?

## Before we begin
* **Required**: Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). ðŸ˜€
* **Required**: Sign up for the [public beta](https://github.com/features/actions) of GitHub Actions. The account that you use for this should be the one you plan on using in the workshop.
* **Helpful**: Familiarity with GitHub ([example training course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)), JavaScript, and GitHub Actions

## :wave: Welcome

Thanks for joining us! In this workshop, we'll take a quick refresher on GitHub _Apps_ and understand how they compare to GitHub _Actions_. We'll guide you through the decision processes needed when understanding how best to integrate with GitHub. And then, weâ€™ll spend some time walking through the conversion of a GitHub App to an Action.
